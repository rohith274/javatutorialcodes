001. Array
    Declare size,items
    ADV - Searching , sorting
    DISADV - same data type , continuous allocation
    If array once is declared then size cannot be changed.
    So, different data structures are invented.
010. ArrayList   
    Declare - similar to database (Resizable)  
    This is for and before java5
    for newer version we got generics.
    Declare - ArrayList<String>
    This ArrayList stores similar tpe of data.
    Doubles the size when a variable is added and copys old data to new one and then add our variable.
011. LinkedList
     Declare - Similar to array list (genric version)
     we cannot assign primitive datatypes in angled
     brackets. There is no class for(int). So, we use
     complex classess like Integer in brackets   
     int - wrapper class = Integer 
     float - wrapper class = float
     DataStructure : 
          - Node Objects
          - Nodes Linked together.
     Resizing Formula :
       - Like boxes connected with link.
       - when a variable is added the a new box is created at end.
ArrayList is faster for retrivng . Linked List is faster for maipulation.  
--------------------------------------------------------------
whenever we use the custom type as complex class.
We get hash values unless get methods are used.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Linke dList , abstract lsit, array list work as same way in case of code. As parent of both lists is same
i.e,, List      
- we can also print both the lists at the same time.
